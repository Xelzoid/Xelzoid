- Hello anyone reading this! I am Zangar, a young programmer from Kazakhstan, 
- I'm currently developing some projects!
- The reason I code is because I like the mental processing that comes with it, so my goal overall is to do some projects, maybe get a good job?
- You can reach me on Insta, Twitter or Discord: @Xelzoid
